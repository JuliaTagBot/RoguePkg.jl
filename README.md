This package defines some methods for functions in `Base.Pkg` that should make testing, benchmarking, and locating files in packages outside the default directory (which is returned by `Pkg.dir()`, eg `~/.julia/v0.6`) easier.

It a stopgap measure, and should be obsoleted by [Pkg3](https://github.com/StefanKarpinski/Pkg3.jl).

## Usage

First, load the module:

```julia
using RoguePkg
```

Then you can refer to packages by the module they contain:

```julia
pkg_for"MyFancyModule"
```

A path:
```julia
pkg_at"~/this_is/where_I/keep/FancyPkg"
```

Or, if you set `ENV[JULIA_LOCAL_PACKAGES]`, by their subdirectory:
```julia
pkg_local"FancyPkg"
```

Then you can use the resulting objects with some functions, including `Pkg.test`, `Pkg.dir`. The methods for the latter even make `PkgBenchmark.benchmarkpkg` work. For example,

```julia
Pkg.test(pkg_for"FancyModule")
```
